# Melanoma Detection Assignment
In this assignment, I built a CNN based model using Tensorflow, to accurately detect melanoma. 
Melanoma - a type of skin cancer can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
An automated solution to detect melanoma can assist and alert dermatologists and has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
Project Background: The project involves constructing a convolutional neural network to automate detection of melanoma.
Business Problem: To automate and assist in the process of melanoma detection.
Data Used: The dataset was formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). It contains 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases. 
The following 9 diseases are represented in the dataset: Actinic keratosis, Basal cell carcinoma, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Nevus, Pigmented benign keratosis, Seborrheic keratosis, Squamous cell carcinoma, and Vascular lesion.

## Conclusions
- The following conclusions were derived from the analysis:
Image augmentation, handling class imbalance and dropout assist in alleviating overfitting of the model
